        Below research summary was divided into three sections. Firstly, it would provide some
        background information about mantis shrimps. Next, it explained some of the reasons that
        make mantis shrimps sucessful predators. The summary ended with some fun facts about this
        animal.

          </header>
          <p>
            <dfn id="def-mantis-shripm">Mantis shrimp</dfn> is categorized as a subclass of
            <strong>crustaceans</strong>, which includes many aquatic animals that have thick
            exoskeleton and multiple pairs of legs, for example lobster, crab, shrimp, etc.
            Reportedly, typical size of a fully grown mantis shrimp is approximately 10 cm; largest
            mantis shrimp ever record was measured at 46 cm in length.

          <p>
            Mantis shrimps usually live in <strong> tropical or sub-tropical waters</strong>. Some
            species prefer hiding in rocks while others prefer burrowing in the seabed. All mantis
            shrimps are aggressive carnivorous; sometimes they hunt and chase for a kill.

          <p>
            Among other crustaceans, mantis shrimps can be recognized by their iconic appearance.
            They <em>look like lobsters</em> but instead of two big clamps, mantis shrimps have two
            front legs that resemble mantis’ front legs. Mantis shrimps can be categorized in two
            group, <strong>spearing</strong> or <strong>smashing</strong>, depend on the shape of
            their front legs.

            <em>Spearer</em> mantis shrimps usually <em>buries</em> themselves beneath the ocean bed
            and use their spear-like front legs to <em>impale</em> the preys that pass by. On the
            other hand, <em>smasher</em> mantis shrimps <em>hide</em> in the coral and use their
            club-like front legs to <em>knock down</em> their preys with brute force.

          <h3>World strongest animal?</h3>

          <p>
            There are several attempts ( for example

              >here</a

            and
            <a href="https://safarisafricana.com/strongest-animals-in-the-world/">here</a> ) to
            shortlist the strongest animals in the world, some rankings even measure how much weight
            these animals can move in comparison with their body weight. In this way, strength is
            assessed <strong>regardless</strong> of their size. For example, dung beetle is the
            strongest animal because it can pull the weight that is more than one thousand times
            heavier than itself. However, mantis shrimps are not featured in any of those lists
            because they don't excel in weight lifting. On the other hand, Guinness World Records
            and
            <abbr title="British Broadcasting Corporation">BBC</abbr>
            listed mantis shrimp as the animal with the <strong>most powerful punch</strong> in the
            animal kingdom.

            A research about predator and prey concluded that in order to be a sucessful predator
            that excels within their hunting environment, one needs to have a good combination of
            senses and physical adaptations. It seems that mantis shirmps' speed, brute force of
            their strike, impresive vision, and shell structure tick all the boxes and turn them
            into formidable hunters.

            <h4>How hard can they hit?</h4>
            <p>
              Reportedly, peacock mantis shrimp, a popular species among mantis shrimp, can swing
              its clubs with the force that is equally strong as a bullet shot from a .22 caliber
              gun. Some sources claimed that the force from these swings could be as much as 150kg,
              or about

            <h4>How fast can they hit?</h4>
            <p>
              Sheer power alone only tells half of the story of mantis shrimp’s punches. The only
              thing that is more impressive than the force of their punches is the speed that those
              punches were thrown. Reportedly, peacock mantis shrimp can
              <strong>accelerate</strong> their clubs at the speed of more than 80 km/h. Most
              importantly, one strike can happen in <strong>less than 800 microseconds</strong>. For
              comparison, on average, our eye blink is between
              <cite
                ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinking#Central_nervous_system's_control"
                  >100-150 milliseconds
                </a></cite
              >. Therefore, theoretically, if a mantis shrimp could keep punching continuously, we
              would miss 500 shrimp’s punches if we blink once. While not as powerful as smasher
              type, spearer type mantis shrimps use this extremely speed to impale their prey.

            <h4>Why don't their front legs break after those powerful strikes?</h4>
            <p>
              In order to protect their front legs from breaking under reaction force, these clubs
              have a special shock absorbent mechanism that is shaped at molecular level. Scientists
              named this structure <em>bouligand</em>. In short, this structure allows small cracks
              to prevent total collapse/ breakage.

            <p>
              As if super force and super speed is not enough, mantis shrimps also have super
              vision. Reportedly, their visual spectrum is broader than any other species in animal
              kingdom, thanks to the 16 colour receptors in their eyes; for comparison, human only
              has three. This allows manthis shrims to see polarized light (light that reflected
              from a flat surface, like mirror or fish scale, etc.) and give them a hughe advantage
              in their environment. On top of that, their eyes are on the stalks that move freely in
              various angles; hence they can have incredibly good view of their surroundings.

          <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
        </header>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The punches of smasher type mantis shrimps are so strong and fast that they also create
            bubbles near their clubs. These under-water bubbles collapse immediately and release a
            flash of light and the heat that is as hot as the <strong>sun’s surface</strong>.
            Therefore, these punches do not need to connect to make the kill.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mantis shrimps can <strong>break glass tank</strong>. Hence, if kept as pet, they should
            be put in a hard plastic tank.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mantis shrimp's bouligand structure is so special that scientists study it in hope of
            producing lighter and stronger materials for car frame as well as explosion shield.
